  <h1>NetworKit Day 2024</h1>
  <p><strong>NetworKit Day 2024</strong> is taking place on <strong>April 9th, 2024</strong> online via Zoom, time slot: 2pm to 6pm CEST. </p>

  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapse4">Event Details</button><br><div id="collapse4" class="collapse in">
    <p><br>This event is about interacting with the community. We share our latest updates, 
      give insights for new users and also offer two workshops: one for beginners and one for advanced users. 
      If you want to attend one or more workshops, better be prepared with a notebook and a modern webbrowser 
      (although it is only for convenience, not a requirement). We also intend to discuss future development 
      directions and receive feedback on the current status of NetworKit.</p>

    <h2>Preliminary program (all times in CET)</h2><br>
    <ul>
      <li>1:00pm - 1:20pm : Welcome and introduction (Henning Meyerhenke, HU Berlin)</li>
      <li>1:20pm - 1:30pm : History and Numbers (Fabian Brandt-Tumescheit, HU Berlin)</li>
      <li>1:30pm - 2:10pm : Scientific Talk: "Robustness of Complex Networks" (Rob Kooij, Tu Delft)</li>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Abstract:</u> Network Science aims to understand the graph structure of networks and the dynamic 
        processes that take place on networks. Examples of processes on networks are transport of items 
        (IP packets with digitalized information, cars, containers) and diffusion (epidemics, electric current,
        water flows, human emotions). The Network Architectures and Services Section at the Delft University of 
        Technology contributes to the fundaments of Network Science: we investigate amongst others geometric 
        representations of networks, epidemic spread on networks, spectra of graphs and network algorithms. In addition, 
        we apply our mathematical knowledge to the design, management and control of critical infrastructures, such 
        as telecom networks and power grids, in order to make these networks robust, resilient, efficient and reliable. 
        In this talk we will give two examples of our results in the field of robustness of complex networks, namely 
        robustness of network controllability and cascading failures in power grids.</li>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The goal of this day is to both present NetworKit to people who don’t know it yet and to update

          <li><u>Abstract:</u> The talk will present a web based platform for network analysis in the digital humanities that is being developed as a work in progress and uses NetworKit as its core analysis engine. The architecture of the platform will be outlined, and we will demonstrate some exploration functions that enhance networks with additional data related to its constituting entities.</li>

    <h3>LUNCH BREAK</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1:30pm - 2:00pm : Scientific Talk: "On Mining Distances out of Massive Time-Evolving Graphs" 
          (Mattia D'Emidio, University of L’Aquila, Italy)</li>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="_static/mdemidio_networkit_day_2020.pdf">Presentation Slides</a></li>
          <li><u>Abstract:</u> Computing shortest-path distances is a fundamental primitive in the context of graph mining, since this kind of information is essential to a broad range of prominent application domains, including among others network analysis, data routing, web search optimization, and route planning. <br><button type="button" class="btn-link collapsed"></button><div class="collapse"> Textbook approaches for shortest paths (e.g. executing Dijkstra’s algorithm or precomputing a distance matrix) do not scale well with the graph’ size, as they either take seconds to answer a single query on the distance or have a huge memory footprint, when the graph has millions of vertices/arcs. Therefore, to achieve faster query answering and affordable space requirements, smarter and more scalable methods have been designed, the most practical of them being based on a compact representation of the transitive closure of the input graph, called the 2-hop-cover labeling. This talk surveys the main characteristics of such methods, along with some recent algorithms that have been introduced to allow the usage of the 2-hop-cover technique in time-evolving scenarios, i.e. the realistic case when the managed graph undergoes topological modifications over time. We discuss empirical evidences, obtained by experimental evaluations on both real-world and synthetic inputs, that suggest that 2-hop-cover based algorithmic frameworks represent the most promising step forward towards an effective solution for mining distances in general, massive, time-evolving graphs. Most results presented in this talk, as well as most results concerning shortest-path queries in massive complex networks, are of experimental nature and have been achieved also thanks to the recent development of effective toolkits for large-scale graph processing, such as NetworKit. Only a few works with worst-case guarantees are known, and only for special cases (e.g. restrictions on the input): this represents a major open problem that deserves further investigation.</div></li>
