The second **NetworKit Day**

September 12, 2017
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are happy to announce the first **NetworKit Day**, which will be held on **September 12, 2017** at the **Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)**, Karlsruhe, Germany.
The goal of this day is to both present NetworKit to people who donâ€™t know it yet and to update more seasoned users and developers about the current features, which have grown quite a bit over the last years. Also, in this meeting we wish to discuss future development directions and receive feedback on the current status of NetworKit. If you would like to attend or receive further information, feel free to send an e-mail to `Elisabetta Bergamini <elisabetta.bergamini@kit.edu>`_.

The meeting will take place in **Room 301, Building 50.34** (Computer Science Department), Am Fasanengarten 5, 76131 Karlsruhe.
