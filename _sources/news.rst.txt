---------------------------------

Mar 10, 2025: **NetworKit 11.1 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`New features`:
    - New RB-Matrix and Graph reader. It is available via :code:`nk.graphio.RBGraphReader` or :code:`nk.readGraph(path,format=nk.graphio.Format.RB)` (`#1264 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1264>`_).
    - The MatrixMarket reader is now available in C++ and Python (`#1236 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1236>`_, `#1262 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1262/>`_)
    - Add new function :code:`isBipartite`, which checks whether a given undirected graph is bipartite. Currently only implemented in C++ (`#1304 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1304>`_).
    - :code:`nk.graphtools.topologicalSort` now has an additional parameter :code:`nodeIdMap`, supplying a map of node ids, if the nodes in the graph are non-contiuous (`#1241 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1241/>`_).
    - Refactored the existing implementation of the Barabasi-Albert graph generator, leading to a significant speedup (`#1175 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1175>`_) for multicore systems due to parallelization. The new implementation is based on "Scalable generation of scale-free graphs" by Sanders and Schulz.
    - A similar treatment was done for RMat-Generator, the Configuration Model and the Chung-Lu Model (`#1164 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1164>`_, `#1186 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1186>`_, `#1177 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1177>`_)
    - LAMG-solver now supports multiple connected components in parallel (`#1212 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1212>`_).
    - The :code:`vizbridges` module now also supports the visualization of edge attributes (`#1230 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1230>`_).
    - :code:`DynBetweennessOneNode` (in module :code:`centrality`) now also supports weighted graphs (`#1245 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1245>`_).


:underline:`New algorithms`:
    - Add `Left-Right Planarity Test <https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=7963e9feffe1c9362eb1a69010a5139d1da3661e>`_ algorithm by U. Brandes, which is used to determine whether a given graph is planar. This algorithm is available in C++ in the new :code:`planarity` module. Thanks for `@Schwarf <https://github.com/Schwarf>`_ for the contribution.
    - Add b-Suitor algorithm both in a static version based on `Efficient Approx. Algorithms for weighted b-Matching <https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1418504>`_ by Khan et al. and a edge dynamic version based on `A Fully-dynamic Approximation Algorithm for Maximum Weight b-Matchings in Graphs <https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09965>`_ by Brandt-Tumescheit et al. Both algorithms are available in C++ and Python in the :code:`matching` module.


:underline:`Further changes and improvements`:
    - Python 3.13 and Numpy 2.X is fully supported, Python versions :code:`<3.10` is not supported anymore. This means, that wheels will only be available for 3.10 or higher.
    - The oldest supported compiler are now GCC 10, LLVM 10. This enables the usage of C++20 features in the code base.
    - Refactor CI pipeline (github actions) in order to detect memory leaks. As a result several minor possible leaks have been resolved (`#1283 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1283>`_).
    - As shown by Sahu et. al in "GVE-Leiden: Fast Leiden Algorithm for Community Detection in Shared Memory Setting" the current implementation of :code:`ParallelLeiden` might create a small fraction of disconnected communities. This behaviour is now documented and will be fixed in a future update.
    - Building NetworKit via :code:`setup.py` does not anymore detect compatible compilers. This is now done in CMake directly, making the building process more robust.


:underline:`Notable Bug-Fixes`:
    - Fix attribute assignment from another attribute :code:`attr[i] = attr[j]` and general copy instructions (`#1279 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1279>`_, `#1251 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1251>`_).
    - Fix edge attributes indexing on dynamic graphs (edge removal, insertion) (`#1257 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1257>`_, `#1299 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1257>`_).
    - Fixed a bug in :code:`SignalHandler`, which led to inconsistent behavior when interrupting parallel code (`#1301 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1301>`_).
    - Fix :code:`RMatGenerator` for instances where the number of nodes exceeded the limit of :code:`uint32_t` (`#1268 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1268>`_).
    - Fix the product of two :code:`DynamicMatrix` instances (`#1252 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1252>`_).
    - Fix a problem in :code:`DynDijkstra`, whereby the shortest path itself was not created properly (`#1240 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1240>`_).
    - :code:`addEdge` now correctly adds missing nodes on dynamic graphs with id holes (`#1232 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1232>`_).
    - :code:`networkit.community.OverlappingNMIDistance` is working again (`#1229 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1229>`_).
    - :code:`networkit.generators.PowerlawDegreeSequence` is working again (`#1196 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/pull/1196>`_).

Jan 30, 2024: **NetworKit 11.0 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`New features`:
    - The :code:`graphio` module now supports guessing the file format of a given graph. :code:`nk.graphio.guessFileFormat` either returns a supported
      graph format from the list (see: https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/python_api/graphio.html#networkit.graphio.Format) or an :code:`IOError`.
      This functionality is used now, if a graph is read by :code:`graphio.readGraph` without giving the file format. See the corresponding
      IO-notebook for more information about the usage.
    - The graph datastructure now supports :code:`EdgeAttributes`. These can be attached/removed/edited similarly to node attributes via Python and
      C++.
    - Refactored :code:`Matrices` from the :code:`algebraic` module. This includes rewriting certain functions and adding new functionality. For
      :code:`CSRMatrix`: functions for iterating over all elements of the matrix, including zeros. For :code:`DenseMatrix`: functions to compute the
      adjacency, Laplacian, and incidence matrix of a graph and a diagonal matrix. For :code:`DynamcMatrix`: functions to iterate over the (non-zero)
      elements. In this way, all matrix classes offer the same set of APIs.
    - A graph can now be constructed from several numpy/scipy data types, including :code:`scipy.sparse.coo_matrix`. The new function is available via
      :code:`nk.GraphFromCoo`. See the corresponding graph-notebook for more information about the usage.
    - The new constructor uses :code:`graph.addEdges` underneath, which is also now available via the Python interface. Based on several numpy/scipy
      data sources, multiple edges can be added. This method has increased performance (5x-10x) with respect to manually creating the graph and adding edges in
      a loop. 
    - The :code:`plot` module in Python was completely rewritten, since most of its functionality was outdated. In addition a notebook is added,
      reflecting the changes.


:underline:`New algorithms (distance)`:
    - Dynamic 2-Hop Landmark Labeling based on https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3299901 . The current implementation is only partially dynamic, since
      only edge insertions are supported.
    - Complex Paths algorithm based on https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24704-6 and the original implementation from
      https://github.com/drguilbe/complexpaths.git . The algorithm is part of the :code:`centrality` module and available in C++ and Python. 

:underline:`Further changes and improvements`:
    - Python 3.12 is now fully supported.
    - :code:`compactEdges()` is now marked as deprecated, since there can not be any holes for missing edges in the data structure anymore. The
      underlying idea of keeping a consistent datastructure (maintaining ordering of edges / correct indexes of edge ids) after dynamic graph updates
      has been moved to new functions :code:`setKeepEdgesSorted()` and :code:`setMaintainCompactEdges()`. These functions set variables, which
      influence running time consuming sanity checks during :code:`removeEdge`. Per default the variables are set to :code:`false` and it is only
      needed to activate them for advanced use cases.   
    - Several deprecated functions are removed entirely or are now integrated in different modules with release 11.0. Some smaller or outdated helper
      modules like :code:`stopwatch` are also removed without replacements. This concerns mostly the Python interface. 
    - Supported compiler now include GCC 13 and Clang 17. Note that compiler older than five years are not officially supported anymore (no changes
      with respect to release 10.1 of NetworKit).
    - The :code:`NetworKitBinary` writer now converts older binary formats (:code:`<3`) automatically to the most recent version 3. With respect to
      previous versions, version 3 supports edge ids.
    - The running time of :code:`HyperbolicGenerator` is improved slightly by using an algorithm, which generates sequences of sorted random numbers.
    - Functions :code:`RandomEdgeScore::score`, :code:`RandomNodeEdgeScore::score` and :code:`Sfigality::maximum` are now implemented.
    - A new notebook is added, describing the usage of dynamic algorithms in NetworKit. It is available via github and the documentation page.

:underline:`Notable Bug-Fixes`:
    - Fixed a bug in :code:`DGSWriter`, where node restoration events were not correctly written to files.
    - Fixed functions :code:`communicationGraph` and :code:`weightedDegreeWithCluster` from :code:`GraphClusteringTools` to return correct data types
      (directed/weighted).
    - Subtraction of two :code:`DenseMatrix` now works correctly.
    - Fixed the previously broken :code:`community.SpectralPartitioner`.
    - :code:`community.kCoreCommunityDetection` gives now correct results.
    - Fixed a heap corruption bug due to missing parameters in the Python interface of :code:`KadabraBetweenness`.
    - Fixed a bug in :code:`BiconnectedComponents`, where the result of the algorithm was incorrect after a node got deleted from the graph data
      structure.
    - Removed a race condition from :code:`Luby` algorithm, leading to erroneous results. As a result, the performance of the algorithm has decreased
      (2-3x loss of speedup).

Mar 23, 2023: **NetworKit 10.1 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`New features`:
    - :code:`TopCloseness` and :code:`TopHarmonicCloseness` now support restriction of the top-k calculation to certain nodes (while the truth is
      given by the complete graph). This can lead to significant speed-up in running time.
    - It is now possible to let :code:`Graph.addEdge()` check for multi-edges when adding new edges. This is disabled by default, since it has an
      impact on the running time of :code:`addEdge()`. The return type changed to indicate whether the edge was added or not.
    - :code:`Node2Vec` now also supports directed graphs. This was a contribution from Klaus Ahrens (@fidus58).
    - Edge weights in a graph can now be randomized by calling :code:`GraphTools::randomizeWeights()` (C++) or
      :code:`networkit.graphtools.randomizeWeights()`. The C++ API also supports adding a custom distribution.

:underline:`New algorithms (distance)`:
    - New algorithm: Pruned Landmark Labeling based on T. Akiba, Y. Iwata, Y. Yoshida, SIGMOD '13. The algorithm computes distance labels which are
      used to answer shortest-path distance queries.

:underline:`Further changes and improvements`:
    - Python 3.11 is now fully supported. With release 10.1 onward, a wheel for Linux, macOS and Windows will be available via all distribution
      channels.
    - Supported compiler now include GCC 12.0 and Clang 15.0. Note that compiler older than five years are not officially supported anymore. This now
      includes Clang :code:`<6.0` and GCC :code:`<8.1` (with the exception of :code:`7.4`).
    - Calling names for enums in both Python and C++ is now unified. Before the change, different enums were written with different naming schemes
      (for example: ClosenessVariant::standard, ClosenessType::OUTBOUND). Also naming scheme between Python and C++ differed in various cases. The new
      convention is: :code:`CamelCase` for identifiers and :code:`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for members. For backwards compatibility all previous calling
      conventions still work (for two releases).
    - In addition all enums in Python are now callable as member of their module. For example: :code:`networkit.centrality.ClosenessType.OUTBOUND`.
    - Previously non-existing edge ids were returned as 0 which could be misleading. Now they return as :code:`none` to be clear that the edge id
      doesn't exist. See https://github.com/networkit/networkit/issues/747 for details.
    - For :code:`SpanningEdgeCentrality`, it is now mandatory to index the edges before running the algorithm. See
      https://github.com/networkit/networkit/issues/967 for details.
    - Improved :code:`MatrixMarketReader` now supports :code:`%`-comments and warns for potential data loss for edge weights bigger than
      :code:`4.5*10^15`.


:underline:`Notable Bug-Fixes`:
    - Fixed bug in :code:`ParallelConnectedComponents`, which lead to occasional segmentation faults in the member function `getComponents()`.
    - :code:`Graph` constructor now supports creation of graphs with indexed edges by passing :code:`edgesIndexed=True`. Before the fix doing so led
      to segmentation faults.
    - Fixed bug for source-target shortest path algorithms (:code:`MultiTargetBFS`, :code:`MultiTargetDijkstra`), which caused segmentation faults
      when passing unreachable targets.
    - Fixed inconsistent weights for graphs created by :code:`GraphTools::toUndirected()`/:code:`graphtools.toUndirected()`. Error occured when
      converting bidirectional edges. Fixed behavior per default creates an undirected edge with the summed up weight of both edges.
    - Fix a potential bug in PLP. A variable was updated non-atomically in a parallel loop, which can lead to a possible race condition.
    - Fixed :code:`NetworkBinaryWriter` error, which led to erroneous graph files when writing graphs with deleted nodes (e.g. by calling
      :code:`G::removeNode(u)`).
    - Fix EdmondsKarp :code:`getMaxFlow()` (for directed graphs) and :code:`getSourceSet()` (for directed/undirected graphs). This is a contribution
      from Jonas Charfreitag (@CharJon).

May 18, 2022: **NetworKit 10.0 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`New features`:
    - Native support for node attributes. In C++ the attributes can be of any type. Python does not support generic data types; thus, NetworKit node
      attributes in Python are restriced to type :code:`int`, :code:`float`, and :code:`str`, and may be subject to changes in the future. See
      https://networkit.github.io/dev-docs/python_api/graph.html#networkit.graph.Graph.attachNodeAttribute for details. The attribute API is still
      considered experimental and may change in the future.
    - New Python module :code:`vizbridges`: provides functions for 2D and 3D graph visualization (via Cytoscape/Plotly) within Jupyter Notebooks. See
      the documentation and our example notebooks for more details. Module :code:`csbridge` is deprecated in favor of vizbridges and respective
      functionality is moved there. An application built on top of vizbridges is described in "Interactive Visualization of Protein RINs using
      NetworKit in the Cloud" (E. Angriman, F. Brandt-Tumescheit, L. Franke, A. van der Grinten, H. Meyerhenke).

:underline:`New algorithms (centrality)`:
    - New algorithm for computing the Local Clustering Coefficient based on squares. This is a contribution from Till Hoffmann (@tillahoffmann) from
      Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
    - New algorithm for Forest Closeness Centrality based on "New Approximation Algorithms for Forest Closeness Centrality - for Individual Vertices
      and Vertex Groups", A. van der Grinten, E. Angriman, M. Predari, H. Meyerhenke, SDM21.

:underline:`Further changes and improvements`:
    - C++ standard updated to version 17, oldest supported compilers are Clang 5.0, GCC 7 (and equivalent MSVC, AppleClang).
    - APSP: support for graphs with non-existing nodes.
    - SPSP: support for a list of target nodes; the algorithm stops once all target nodes have been visited.
    - Distance module: all algorithms support returning distances as a numpy array (via :code:`getDistances()`), which is more efficient than
      returning Python lists. The new approach also enables straightforward consumption of centrality scores by numpy-compatible APIs and may be
      enabled by default in the future. This is a contribution from Till Hoffmann (@tillahoffmann) from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
    - Dynamics module: possibility to compare graph events via binary operators, available both in C++ and Python.
    - Generators module: removal of the quadratic version of the Barabasi Albert Generator. See https://github.com/networkit/networkit/issues/787 for
      details.
    - Graph class: the algorithm to compute Kruskal Minimum Spanning Forest now uses the SpanningForest algorithm for undirected graphs. This leads to
      a general performance improvement.
    - Deprecation of several Python modules: :code:`csbridge`, :code:`exceptions`, :code:`GEXFIO`, :code:`GraphMLIO`, :code:`partitioning`,
      :code:`sampling`, :code:`stopwatch`, :code:`viztasks`, :code:`workflows`. Note that some functionalities are moved to other modules. See
      documentation of further details.
    - Improvement of the Python documentation. Doc-strings now report input parameters, return values, and inheritance relationship.
    - Python APIs for the Maxent-Stress layout algorithm now support 3D coordinates.

:underline:`Notable Bug-Fixes`:
    - Fixed bug in the dynamic Dijkstra implementation (after an edge update, some distances were not updated correctly).

|

July 1, 2021: **NetworKit 9.0 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`New feature`
    - Windows 7, 8.1 and 10: possibility to install NetworKit via pip. Currently we have no pre-built wheel-package available so you have to make sure
      that the MSVC-compiler (cl.exe) can be found when installing NetworKit via pip. A possible solution is to call "pip" from within "Native Tools
      Command Prompt" provided by Visual Studio. This feature will be further improved in the future.

February 23, 2021: **NetworKit 8.1 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`New features`

- New embedding module that implements the node2vec algorithm based on "node2vec: Scalable feature learning for networks" by Grover and Leskovec (KDD
  2016). The embedding module is available for both C++ and Python.
- New csbridge Python module that allows to draw colored graphs inline in a jupyter notebook via ipycytoscape.
- Better implementation of :code:`ClusterRandomGraphGenerator`: now it takes linear time and supports parallelism.
- Added support for Binder. Newer branches from NetworKit can now be accessed directly from Binder. Currently supported are master (newest stable) and
  8.1 (release version).

:underline:`For developers`

- We raised the minimum required clang version from 3.8 to 3.9.
- It is now possible to create the Python package against an external pre-build tlx-library. To use it, add :code:`--external-tlx=<TLX_PATH>` to
  :code:`setup.py build_ext-phase`.
- All clang-tidy warnings have been resolved and will be treated as errors by our CI pipeline. Some of the clang-tidy checks also involve possible
  performance enhancements and/or lowering of the memory footprint by avoiding unnecessary copies. The exact benefit depends on the use-case.
- Several warning and documentation fixes.

:underline:`Notable bugfixes`

- When using custom compilers on macOS (for example homebrew gcc compiler) and NetworKit was built from source with an external core, this created a
  NetworKit installation with incompatible core and cython-extension libraries.
- In :code:`KatzCentrality`, the parameter alpha was set to 0 by default. This caused the edges to be ignored and every node got the same centrality.

September 08, 2020: **NetworKit 7.1 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`New features for Contributors / Developers`

- We restructured the Cython-Interface (responsible for the connection between Python and C++ core-libraries) in order to make development and
  maintenance more approachable. As a result the previous monolithic file :code:`_NetworKit.pyx` is now split into modules, resembling the structure
  of the C++ code. New modules can be added easily by providing appropriate Cython-files in sub-folder `networkit
  <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/tree/master/networkit>`_.

:underline:`Additional Notes`

- Beginning with release :code:`7.1` (:code:`7.0` also available) NetworKit is now also distributed via package managers conda, spack and brew. All
  channels provide different packages for the C++ headers/library and the complete Python/C++ software. Head over to `github
  <https://github.com/networkit/networkit>`_ for installation instructions.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- "Scaling up Network Centrality Computations - a Brief Overview" was accepted for publishing in the journal `it - Information Technology
  <https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/itit/62/1/itit.62.issue-1.xml>`_.

March 1, 2020: **NetworKit 6.1.0 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following you see an overview about the contributions, which went into NetworKit 6.1.0. Note that this version is fully compatible with release
6.0.0.

:underline:`New features`

- Introducing new iterators for nodes and edges to have a coherent, idiomatic and fast way to repeate tasks for different elements of a graph.
  Syntax-wise the iterators can be called similarly in Python and C++. In Python iterating can be invoked by :code:`for x in graph.iterNodes()`,
  whereas the counter-part for C++ works with :code:`for(node x: graph.nodeRange())`. Internally, all functions in NetworKit already use the new
  iterators.
- cmake adds more options to support variants of clang-compilers with OpenMP for macOS and Linux. This includes conda, homebrew and
  MacPort-environments.


:underline:`Bugfixes`

- Generating a graph with the Watts-Strogatz algorithm does not lead anymore to infinite loops, when passing a number of neighbors per node, which is
  equal to the total number of nodes in the graph. (See issue `#505 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/issues/505>`_)
- Fixed error in function inNeighbors, including not all parameters in call to underlying library. (See issue `#469
  <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/issues/469>`_)
- The z-coordinate is now correctly scaled when writing a graph to GML. (See issue `#500 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/issues/500>`_)
- ConnectedComponents::extractLargestConnectedComponent now returns a compacted graph if called with appropriate parameters.


:underline:`Deprecated features`

- Nested-parallelism-feature is now marked as deprecated.

|
|

February 24, 2020: **NetworKit 6.0.1 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`Patch notes`

- Added an option to cmake (-DNETWORKIT_EXT_TLX), which enables to link against an externally built tlx-library
- Updated travis-configuration in order to remove deprecated options
- Fixed a `bug <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/issues/491>`_, which prevented the headers from ttmath to be installed correctly

|
|

November 29, 2019: **NetworKit 6.0 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`New features`

- NetworKit binary graphs: new binary graph format that is both smaller usually smaller than text-based formats and also faster to read. The format
  allows for parallel reading. It supports (un-)directed as well as (un-)weighted graphs and deleted nodes.
- KadabraBetweenness: implementation of a new parallel algorithm for betweenness approximation. This is based on the definition from "Parallel
  Adaptive Sampling with almost no Synchronization", A. van der Grinten, E. Angriman, H. Meyerhenke
- New method in ConnetedComponents to extract the largest connected component of a given graph.
- BidirectionalBFS and BidirectionalDijkstra: new algorithms for faster graph exploration when the target vertex is known.
- New method in Graph to remove all duplicate edges (i.e. additional edges with same source and same target as another edge).
- New notebooks with tutorials for Centrality, Community detection, Components, Distance, Generators, Graph, Graph read/write, Randomization.
- Removal of deprecated features (see list below for more informations)
- New release cycle and version numbering: NetworKit now releases a major release every half a year, and an optional minor release every quarter. See
  you in summer 2020 for NetworKit 7.0 then.
- Package Manager support: conda, spack, brew and more packages will be created starting with 6.0. They will follow the github/PyPI-release in the
  coming weeks.


:underline:`New features for developers`

- Clang format: new .clang-format configuration file to format NetworKit C++ files.
- Header files: all C++ header files have been moved to the include/ directory.

:underline:`Notable bugfixes`

- "make install" and "ninja install" now correctly install the NetworKIt C++ library together with its header files. The pkg-config utility is
  supported to link against the library.
- NetworKit now always logs to stderr instead of stdout (regardless of the log level). This change makes life easier for programs that link against
  NetworKit as a library but also need to adhere to a specific output format on stdout.
- ApproxGroupBetweenness now uses much less memory and can scale to larger graphs.

:underline:`Deprecated features`

- The following Graph methods have been deprecated: getId, typ, setName, getName, toString, nodes, edges, neighbors, time, timeStep.
- The following Graph methods have been deprecated and moved to GraphTools: copyNodes, subgraphFromNodes, transpose, BFSfrom, DFSfrom. toUnweighted,
  toUndirected, append, merge, volume
- A deprecated constructor of the KONECTGraphReader class has been removed.
- The deprecated FrutchermanReingold, and MultilevelLayouter algorithms have been removed.
- The deprecated MaxClique algorithm has been removed.
- The deprecated SSSP::getStack() method has been removed.
- The following deprecated methods in Graph have been removed: addNode(float, float), setCoordinate, getCoordinate, minCoordinate, maxCoordinate,
  initCoordinate

network analysis to even more people.

|
|

December 13, 2016: **NetworKit 4.2 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Today we announce the next version of NetworKit, the open-source toolkit for large-scale network analysis. NetworKit is a Python package, with
performance-critical algorithms implemented in C++/OpenMP.

**Release notes**

Major:

- New graph drawing algorithm for the Maxent-stress model; the algorithm can layout even large graphs quickly. It follows the paper by Gansner et al.
  with some modifications; the biggest deviation is the use of the LAMG solver for the Laplacian linear systems
- Parallel implementation for the approximation of the neighborhood function; class has been refactored from ApproxNeighborhoodFunction to
  NeighborhoodFunctionApproximation.
- New heuristic algorithm for the neighborhood function. It is based on sampling and the breadth-first search and offers more flexibility with regards
  to the tradeoff between running time and accuracy as the number of samples can be specified by the user. It is also much faster than the
  approximation algorithm for networks with a high diameter (e.g. road networks).

Minor:

- Iterative implementation of components.StronglyConnectedComponents, which is now the new default. For graphs where edges have been deleted, it is
  recommended to use the recursive implementation, which is still available.
- Removed heuristic for vertex diameter estimation from centrality.ApproxBetweenness (now the vertex diameter is estimated as suggested in Riondato,
  Kornaropoulos: Fast approximation of betweenness centrality through sampling)
- Refactoring of the approximation algorithms in the distance group. ApproxNAME -> NAMEApproximation.
- Simplified installation procedure: Install required dependencies automatically

July 05, 2016: **NetworKit 4.1.1 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a more of a maintenance release, that fixes the pip package and building with clang is possible again (at least with version 3.8).

Note: You can control which C++ compiler the setup.py of the networkit package is supposed to use with e.g. :code:`CXX=clang++ pip install networkit`.
This may be helpful when the setup fails to detect the compiler.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NetworKit 3.0 is the next major release of our open-source toolkit for high-performance network analysis. Since the last release in November,
NetworKit has received several improvements under the hood as well as an extension of the feature set. What started as a testbed for parallel
community detection algorithms has evolved into a diverse set of tools that make it easy to characterize complex networks. This has been successfully
scaled to large data sets with up to several billions of edges.

This being an open-source project, we are very interested in incorporating feedback from data analysts and algorithm engineers. Feel free to contact
us with any question on how NetworKit could be applied in your field of research. |br| |br|
