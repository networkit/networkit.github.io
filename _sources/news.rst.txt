July 1, 2021: **NetworKit 9.0 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`New feature`
    - Windows 7, 8.1 and 10: possibility to install NetworKit via pip. Currently we have no pre-built wheel-package available so you have to make sure that the MSVC-compiler (cl.exe) can be found when installing NetworKit via pip. A possible solution is to call "pip" from within "Native Tools Command Prompt" provided by Visual Studio. This feature will be further improved in the future.


:underline:`New algorithms`

Centrality:
    - Greedy algorithm for group harmonic closeness based on "Group-Harmonic and Group-Closeness Maximization - Approximation and Engineering", E. Angriman, R. Becker, G. D'Angelo, H. Gilbert, A. van der Grinten, H. Meyerhenke, ALENEX 2021. This algorithm is available in :code:`networkit.centrality.GroupHarmonicCloseness`.
    - Local search approximation algorithm for group closeness based on the aforementioned ALENEX 2021 paper. This algorithm is available in :code:`networkit.centrality.GroupClosenessLocalSearch`.
    - Heuristic algorithm for group closeness (LS-Restrict) based on "Local Search for Group Closeness Maximization on Big Graphs", E.Angriman, A. van der Grinten, H. Meyerhenke, IEEE BigData 2019. This algorithm is available in :code:`networkit.centrality.GroupClosenessLocalSwaps`.
    - New algorithm for Normalized PageRank based on "Comparing Apples and Oranges: Normalized PageRank for Evolving Graphs", K. Berberich, S. Bedathur, G. Weikum, M. Vazirgiannis, WWW 2007. The algorithm is available in :code:`networkit.centrality.PageRank`.

Community Detection:
    - Based on Map Equation, available via :code:`networkit.community.LouvainMapEquation`. For further information about the algorithm, see "The map equation", M. Rosvall, D. Axelsson, C. T. Bergstrom, EPJ ST 2009.
    -  Based on Overlapping Normalized Mutual Information, from the paper  "Normalized Mutual Information to Evaluate Overlapping", A. McDaid, D. Greene, N. Hurley, Physics and Society 2011. This algorithm is available in :code:`networkit.community.OverlappingNMIDistance`.

Matching:
    - Suitor matcher, based on "New Effective Multithreaded Matching Algorithms", F. Manne and M. Halappanavar, IPDPS 2014. This algorithm is available in :code:`networkit.matching.SuitorMatcher`.

GraphTools:
    - New function :code:`subgraphFromNodes`: returns an induced subgraph based on an input graph
    - The previous :code:`subgraphFromNodes` has been renamed to :code:`subgraphAndNeighborsFromNodes` in order to better reflect its functionality


:underline:`Further changes and improvements`
    - Template implementation of CSRMatrix
    - Clang-analyzer warnings are fixed and treated as errors
    - Improved performance of graph writers
    - Possibility to try-out NetworKit without installation: binder support + cloud instances

February 23, 2021: **NetworKit 8.1 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`New features`

- New embedding module that implements the node2vec algorithm based on "node2vec: Scalable feature learning for networks" by Grover and Leskovec (KDD 2016). The embedding module is available for both C++ and Python.
- New csbridge Python module that allows to draw colored graphs inline in a jupyter notebook via ipycytoscape.
- Better implementation of :code:`ClusterRandomGraphGenerator`: now it takes linear time and supports parallelism.
- Added support for Binder. Newer branches from NetworKit can now be accessed directly from Binder. Currently supported are master (newest stable) and 8.1 (release version).

:underline:`For developers`

- We raised the minimum required clang version from 3.8 to 3.9.
- It is now possible to create the Python package against an external pre-build tlx-library. To use it, add :code:`--external-tlx=<TLX_PATH>` to :code:`setup.py build_ext-phase`.
- All clang-tidy warnings have been resolved and will be treated as errors by our CI pipeline. Some of the clang-tidy checks also involve possible performance enhancements and/or lowering of the memory footprint by avoiding unnecessary copies. The exact benefit depends on the use-case.
- Several warning and documentation fixes.

:underline:`Notable bugfixes`

- When using custom compilers on macOS (for example homebrew gcc compiler) and NetworKit was built from source with an external core, this created a NetworKit installation with incompatible core and cython-extension libraries.
- In :code:`KatzCentrality`, the parameter alpha was set to 0 by default. This caused the edges to be ignored and every node got the same centrality.

|

January 15, 2021: **New paper using NetworKit**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The paper "New Approximation Algorithms for Forest Closeness Centrality - for Individual Vertices and Vertex Groups" (authors: van der Grinten, Angriman, Predari, Meyerhenke) was selected for publication by `SIAM Data Mining 2021 <https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/sdm21>`_. In the paper NetworKit is used for computing the experimental data. We also plan to include the new Forest Closeness Centrality algorithms in future releases.

|
|

December 18, 2020: **NetworKit 8.0 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`New features`

- Possibility to specify edge directions for Katz centrality

- New algorithm: SPSP (Some Pairs Shortest Paths), as APSP but with user-specified source vertices

:underline:`New features for Contributors / Developers`

- We moved our continious integration testing from Travis-CI to Github Actions. While the test-coverage stays the same, testing time is significantly reduced. This results in faster feedback for your pull requests.
- Based on our rule to support compilers which are 5 years old, the minimum support for gcc was raised to version 5.
- NetworKit now support C++14 features.

:underline:`Further Improvements`

- The documentation is improved and includes rendering-fixes, when dealing with certain elements like formulas.

|
|

September 08, 2020: **NetworKit 7.1 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`New features for Contributors / Developers`

- We restructured the Cython-Interface (responsible for the connection between Python and C++ core-libraries) in order to make development and maintenance more approachable. As a result the previous monolithic file :code:`_NetworKit.pyx` is now split into modules, resembling the structure of the C++ code. New modules can be added easily by providing appropriate Cython-files in sub-folder `networkit <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/tree/master/networkit>`_.

:underline:`Further Improvements`

- Refactored the `EdgeListReader`, leading to a speed-up when reading in edge-list based graph files.

:underline:`Additional Notes`

- Beginning with release :code:`7.1` (:code:`7.0` also available) NetworKit is now also distributed via package managers conda, spack and brew. All channels provide different packages for the C++ headers/library and the complete Python/C++ software. Head over to `github <https://github.com/networkit/networkit>`_ for installation instructions.

March 1, 2020: **NetworKit 6.1.0 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following you see an overview about the contributions, which went into NetworKit 6.1.0. Note that this version is fully compatible with release 6.0.0.

:underline:`New features`

- Introducing new iterators for nodes and edges to have a coherent, idiomatic and fast way to repeate tasks for different elements of a graph. Syntax-wise the iterators can be called similarly in Python and C++. In Python iterating can be invoked by :code:`for x in graph.iterNodes()`, whereas the counter-part for C++ works with :code:`for(node x: graph.nodeRange())`. Internally, all functions in NetworKit already use the new iterators.
- cmake adds more options to support variants of clang-compilers with OpenMP for macOS and Linux. This includes conda, homebrew and MacPort-environments.


:underline:`Bugfixes`

- Generating a graph with the Watts-Strogatz algorithm does not lead anymore to infinite loops, when passing a number of neighbors per node, which is equal to the total number of nodes in the graph. (See issue `#505 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/issues/505>`_)
- Fixed error in function inNeighbors, including not all parameters in call to underlying library. (See issue `#469 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/issues/469>`_)
- The z-coordinate is now correctly scaled when writing a graph to GML. (See issue `#500 <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/issues/500>`_)
- ConnectedComponents::extractLargestConnectedComponent now returns a compacted graph if called with appropriate parameters.


:underline:`Deprecated features`

- Nested-parallelism-feature is now marked as deprecated.

|
|

February 24, 2020: **NetworKit 6.0.1 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`Patch notes`

- Added an option to cmake (-DNETWORKIT_EXT_TLX), which enables to link against an externally built tlx-library
- Updated travis-configuration in order to remove deprecated options
- Fixed a `bug <https://github.com/networkit/networkit/issues/491>`_, which prevented the headers from ttmath to be installed correctly

|
|

November 29, 2019: **NetworKit 6.0 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`New features`

- NetworKit binary graphs: new binary graph format that is both smaller usually smaller than text-based formats and also faster to read. The format allows for parallel reading. It supports (un-)directed as well as (un-)weighted graphs and deleted nodes.
- KadabraBetweenness: implementation of a new parallel algorithm for betweenness approximation. This is based on the definition from "Parallel Adaptive Sampling with almost no Synchronization", A. van der Grinten, E. Angriman, H. Meyerhenke
- New method in ConnetedComponents to extract the largest connected component of a given graph.
- BidirectionalBFS and BidirectionalDijkstra: new algorithms for faster graph exploration when the target vertex is known.
- New method in Graph to remove all duplicate edges (i.e. additional edges with same source and same target as another edge).
- New notebooks with tutorials for Centrality, Community detection, Components, Distance, Generators, Graph, Graph read/write, Randomization.
- Removal of deprecated features (see list below for more informations)
- New release cycle and version numbering: NetworKit now releases a major release every half a year, and an optional minor release every quarter. See you in summer 2020 for NetworKit 7.0 then.
- Package Manager support: conda, spack, brew and more packages will be created starting with 6.0. They will follow the github/PyPI-release in the coming weeks.


:underline:`New features for developers`

- Clang format: new .clang-format configuration file to format NetworKit C++ files.
- Header files: all C++ header files have been moved to the include/ directory.

:underline:`Notable bugfixes`

- "make install" and "ninja install" now correctly install the NetworKIt C++ library together with its header files. The pkg-config utility is supported to link against the library.
- NetworKit now always logs to stderr instead of stdout (regardless of the log level). This change makes life easier for programs that link against NetworKit as a library but also need to adhere to a specific output format on stdout.
- ApproxGroupBetweenness now uses much less memory and can scale to larger graphs.

:underline:`Deprecated features`

- The following Graph methods have been deprecated: getId, typ, setName, getName, toString, nodes, edges, neighbors, time, timeStep.
- The following Graph methods have been deprecated and moved to GraphTools: copyNodes, subgraphFromNodes, transpose, BFSfrom, DFSfrom. toUnweighted, toUndirected, append, merge, volume
- A deprecated constructor of the KONECTGraphReader class has been removed.
- The deprecated FrutchermanReingold, and MultilevelLayouter algorithms have been removed.
- The deprecated MaxClique algorithm has been removed.
- The deprecated SSSP::getStack() method has been removed.

|

December 13, 2016: **NetworKit 4.2 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Today we announce the next version of NetworKit, the open-source toolkit for large-scale network analysis. NetworKit is a Python package, with performance-critical algorithms implemented in C++/OpenMP.

**Release notes**

Major:

- New graph drawing algorithm for the Maxent-stress model; the algorithm can layout even large graphs quickly. It follows the paper by Gansner et al. with some modifications; the biggest deviation is the use of the LAMG solver for the Laplacian linear systems
- Parallel implementation for the approximation of the neighborhood function; class has been refactored from ApproxNeighborhoodFunction to NeighborhoodFunctionApproximation.
- New heuristic algorithm for the neighborhood function. It is based on sampling and the breadth-first search and offers more flexibility with regards to the tradeoff between running time and accuracy as the number of samples can be specified by the user. It is also much faster than the approximation algorithm for networks with a high diameter (e.g. road networks).

Minor:

- Iterative implementation of components.StronglyConnectedComponents, which is now the new default. For graphs where edges have been deleted, it is recommended to use the recursive implementation, which is still available.
- Removed heuristic for vertex diameter estimation from centrality.ApproxBetweenness (now the vertex diameter is estimated as suggested in Riondato, Kornaropoulos: Fast approximation of betweenness centrality through sampling)
- Refactoring of the approximation algorithms in the distance group. ApproxNAME -> NAMEApproximation.
- Simplified installation procedure: Install required dependencies automatically

Aug 19, 2015: **NetworKit 3.6 released**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have released version 3.6 today. Thank you to all contributors. Here are the release notes.

*Release Notes*

Major Updates:

Link Prediction

Link prediction methods try to predict the likelihood of a future or missing connection between two nodes in a given network. The new module networkit.linkprediction contains various methods from the literature.

Edge Sparsification

Sparsification reduces the size of networks while preserving structural and statistical properties of interest. The module networkit.sparsification provides methods for rating edges by importance and then filtering globally by these scores. The methods are described in http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00564


Further Updates:

- Improved support for directed graph in analysis algorithms
- Improved support for the Intel compiler
- Reader/writer for the GEXF (Gephi) graph file format
- EdgeListReader now reads edge list with arbitrary node ids (e.g.strings) when continuous=False; getNodeMap() returns a mapping from file node ids to graph node ids
- EdgeListReader/Writer now add weights when reading files/writing graphs to file. |br| |br|
